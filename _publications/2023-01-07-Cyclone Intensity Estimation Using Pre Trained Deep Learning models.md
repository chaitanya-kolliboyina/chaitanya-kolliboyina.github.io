excerpt: 'Cyclones are categorized into various categories based on their
intensity which is calculated by various methods and sources. Estimation of the intensity of
cyclone helps them to categorize. Based on that the government and people can take
precautionary measures to avoid the huge loss of life and property. India meteorological
Department uses the Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale to categorize the cyclones into 7
categories. For this project we are using the INSAT3D Infrared & Raw Cyclone Imagery
2012-2021 from the kaggle. The Raw Data has been sourced from the MOSDAC server. It
consists of cyclone images, infrared images of cyclones. It consists of 140 images of cyclones
from 2012-2021 that were happened around India. In this project we are trying to estimate the
intensity of cyclones using the- state-of-the-art deep learning models as they are pre-trained on the large datasets. We are using Four pre-trained deep learning models to compare the
results of this approach.'
