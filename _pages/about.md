👨🏻‍💻 I'm a recent undergraduate student with a passion for deep learning and machine learning. My expertise lies in machine learning, where I am well-versed in utilizing Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. Additionally, I have hands-on experience in deep learning, working with neural networks using TensorFlow, Keras, and pre-trained models.
